# Google-Landmark-Detection
This is solution to a Kaggle Competition under the same name as that of the Repository.
Did you ever go through your vacation photos and ask yourself: What is the name of this temple I visited in China? Who created this monument I saw in France? Landmark recognition can help! This technology can predict landmark labels directly from image pixels, to help people better understand and organize their photo collections.

Today, a great obstacle to landmark recognition research is the lack of large annotated datasets. In this competition, we present the largest worldwide dataset to date, to foster progress in this problem. This competition challenges Kagglers to build models that recognize the correct landmark (if any) in a dataset of challenging test images.
In this competition, you are asked to take test images and recognize which landmarks (if any) are depicted in them. The test images are listed in test.csv, while train.csv contains a large number of images labeled with their associated landmarks. Test images may depict no landmark, one landmark, or more than one landmark. The training set images are each associated to exactly one landmark: each image has a unique id (a hash) and each landmark has a unique label (an integer).
The train.csv to this project is available in my drive
